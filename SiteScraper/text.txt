              







































Hello everyone! Everyone's gorgeous art has been uploaded for the world to see! Dragon Art is hosted in the second post of this thread, while human/gijinka art is in the third post. All of the entries are organized alphabetically by recipient's usernames, so your presents will be easier to find. :)







 I have already PM'd some backup Santas who will get art to you as soon as possible! I am incredibly sorry for the inconvenience. :(





And finally, thank you all so much for making this event a smashing success! Happy holidays and we hope to see you all next year!

Hey everyone! It's been a long while (two years, to be precise ;v;). If you all remember back in 2015, we ran a 

 event. You guys asked to be pinged if we ever ran the event again, so here we are, running it again in 2017! Please take a moment to review the rules on the front page (we've made a few updates including allowing human OCs to be used as references!) and sign up using the Google doc form, if you're still interested. Thank you and have a wonderful day! :)            


              Signed up! I can't wait! ^^            


              @





Signed up. Really excited to see what I can draw.              


              @





I had signed up as well! Good luck to all! : )            


              Signed up! Thanks for this nice event :D            


              I signed up! I'm looking forward to seeing who I get!!! :)            


              ^            


              Signed up! Can't wait to see what I get to draw :)            


              Already 

 participants and it's not even close to midway through November!





Thank you all for joining and the 

 of y'all who signed up for backup artist too :D





The more the merrier so be sure to poke your artist friends, non-artists friends, your dragon friends, the Khaleesi, whomever, and make this year even 

 than 2015's (which I didn't help host, so if this year is awesomer 

  we'll have even more fun)!            


              :0            


              just signed up!! This looks super fun, I can't wait for Christmas :D            


              Decided to sign up for my first Christmas on flight rising, its funny it's felt like a lot longer haha


This'll be my first secret santa too, so I'm excited it seems like it'll be fun, I can't wait <3            


              Tiny boop! We're up to 24 signups now!!            


              Would feral/other OCs be considered with the dragons or the humans/gijinkas or are they just not allowed?            


              @

 





Uh, sorry, I interpreted that wrong. You are free to have other OCs, but 

. This would fall under the 'dragon' category.            


              boops            


              @

 Pinging self c: I may sign up. This looks like a lot of fun!

              @

, @

 and @

 Would it be alright if I attempt to make a button?             


              @


Yes please, go for it! That's very sweet of you to offer. :) We are planning on setting up our own buttons once the banner is finalized, but honestly the more buttons the merrier! xD Thank you so much! :)





These are the dimensions I had in mind for the size of the buttons, but you can make them however big you'd like~





(98 x 98px) - small, square button to fit a signature


(400px wide by 98px tall) - banner to fit in a clan profile


(500px wide by 98px tall) - banner to fit in a forum signature.            


              Im looking so forward for thiiiis! Signed up!            


              @

 I'm on a school computer that blacks every picture ever so I can't see it but I checked to see if this button worked last night and it did then so hopefully it is now :)





It's my first time making a button and I think this one could be a nice temporary one until you guys can make a nicer, more artsy one c:












            


              i signed up!! thanks for having us            


              

 signups now! Just as an FYI, the stuff put in the 'references' will be quoted when sent to your matchup, so you can utilize forum/PM tags. We would also like if you put direct URLs to your dragons, for the artists' convenience.





@

 Thank you! We appreciate it :3            


              @


Thank you so much, it looks great! I'll update the front post with your button once I get on my laptop :)

This seems fun. Will there be a pinglist for when all the artworks get posted here? If so, I'd like a ping. Thanks for hosting such a wonderful event!            


              @

 Yup! Everyone will receive a ping once artwork is posted. The format will look like 

.            


              @





Thank you. All the art looks amazing. I hope I can live up to that in this year's event.

Fun fact: While most axolotls in captivity are white in color, wild axolotls are often a greenish brown or black!            


              For those that signed-up, if you ever feel the need to update what you wrote for your references, let us know and we can update it for you!            


              signed up! this seems like a lot of fun!            


              

            


              Signed up boys.~            


              Fun fact: did you know that axolotls can regenerate any part of their body, such as their tails, jaws, and even brains! To top it all off, their regenerated parts don't leave behind scar tissue.            


              

 signups now with 

 backups! Are you guys excited? Because I am very excited!            


              I am still very excited as I bump this thread!            


              Maybe a not-so-fun fact: Axolotls were actually a Xochimilco delicacy before they became critically endangered. Certain restaurants in Japan still serve whole axolotls. Apparently they taste like white fish meat but with a crunch!

 "[...] anyone of any skill level is welcome to join in the festivities!" Master Lizzi approves of

Wonderful, glad you have you on board!! :D

Heya! I just did a quick sweep of the responses we received, and I didn't see one under your name. D: I'm not sure what happened, if Google ate the response or the form didn't submit properly, or something. Would you mind resubmitting the Google form? I don't want you to be left out over a glitch in the system ;v;





Just wanted to give you a headsup since today is the signup deadline! (Though the other organizers and I are likely going to extend the deadline by a day.) Thanks!            


              Looking forward to this!^^            


              @

 Oh, thanks for letting me know, something must have went wrong :/ I've submitted the form again, it gave me a "Your response has been recorded message", so I guess it's okay now, let me know :)            


              @


Perfect, the response shows up for me as well! Thanks for joining us :D            


              On account of the speedy automated systems, 

 and will 

, tomorrow, rather than today.            


              We've got 96 signups!! Can we make it 100 :0


            


              @





With the extended sign up day, does that mean that we won't be getting PM'd until Sunday? (Hoping to get 100 sign ups as well, but I'm also really excited.)

Hello everyone! I hope you all had a fabulous Thanksgiving if you live in the US. c:





So just a headsup that we've extended the signup deadline for the Secret Santa Art Trade to Saturday, Nov. 25th at rollover. If you know anyone who's been wanting to join this event, let them know it's their last chance to sign up! Additionally, entrants are allowed to make modifications to their entries with a soft deadline of Nov. 25th at rollover. We may allow some wiggle room before we package the messenger pigeons and send them on their way to their Secret Santas. c:





Please take a moment to review 

 and ensure that your information is correct! If you'd like to make any corrections, please notify one of the event organizers and we will make the correction for you! (@

 @

 @

) Please do not submit a second form as that could mess up the matchmaking process.





Thank you and have a wonderful day!

 hi i would like the last link in my subbmission be changed to this ling            


              @


Fixed!            


              @

I would like to delete this sentence xP:


"These are my top 3 choices, but any dragon from the 1st or 2nd page of my lair is okay as well!".            


              @

 @

 @


I've done a command f and can't seem to find myself on the form. Am I on there?            


              @


Oooh sorry didn't realize you wanted to delete it when you sent the PM. Should be fixed now!





@


Yep you should be on there! On row 63 :D            


              @


oh okay I will take another look :) maybe my computer just wasn't thinking.            


              @





It depends; I too, am quite excited and want to give everyone as much time to draw as possible, so I'll be evaluating how many signups we get tomorrow. Once it seems there's no more submissions possible (specifically last second stragglers) I'll start the PMing. If probable, I might even send PMs as soon as I can, after rollover ends.            


              @





Could you please add "But any dragon without art before "FirstGenOne" works too! Most of them should have short bios for reference." In my references? Aaaa thank you!            


              @


Fixed! :D            


              @





Thank you ^^ and You forgot the letter i in my nick xd            


              @


Could it be added that im alright with drawing human or animal art as well?             


              @


Put you down as Either/No Preference, let me know if you'd have one you're more leaning towards :)            


              holy crap, thank the stars for the extension >.>


//signs up real quick            


              Boop            


              I can't view the spreadsheet due to being on mobile, so hopefully Everything is correct?            


              @





I signed up yesterday and then checked the spreadsheet but don't see myself there...hopefully it worked though!            


              @





Yup! We got your response; it wasn't transferred to the copy, but I'll do that when I get the chance!





@





Can you download the Google Sheets app or check on a computer? If you wanna be 100% certain I can PM you what you wrote.            


              @





Hoosh, I just found this today!  So glad I did, too.  Signed up :3            


              Looks like fun! I’m happy I caught it before sign ups close.            


              @





i found this thread too late to sign up for the event itself, but can i possibly sign up as only a  backup santa? i had a lot of fun with this event in 2015, and i would love to help by filling in, just in case.





i hope its not too late, but if its not possible thats no problem- i can take a no. let me know!            


              @


Signups are still open!! They close at rollover, so in about 8 hours :)            


              @





thats embarrassing... i got fooled because its 55 minutes into the 26th of november here. i'll go sign up now, thanks for letting me know!            


              @


Of course! Happy to have you on board again :D            


              Boop, 6 hours remain            


              3 hours remain with 106 signups!!

Hey everyone! Signups officially closed a few hours ago, and now the event currently has 

 Secret Santas on board!! I'm absolutely astounded that we were able to beat the last event's attendance of 101 people, thank you guys so much! <3





All of you should be receiving PMs from Hexlash at this point detailing who your recipient is and what you will be drawing for them. If you did not receive a PM, please let us know ASAP! We had some technical difficulties that caused a formatting error, so you may have received more than one message. 





If you have any additional questions for your recipient, please ask us (the organizers) to deliver your questions to them, so your identity is kept secret. :)





That's all for now; if you have any more questions in general about the event, feel free to ask us! Thanks and happy holidays!            


              Yay!            


              Whoo! I'm excited :D

 For sure, feel free to sign your work on your picture! We'll also be tagging each artist with  their respective artwork on Christmas Day where everyone's art gets showcased in the thread here.


If you like, you could also send an unmarked version to your recipient on Christmas as well.

Hey everyone! Just a quick little reminder that the deadline to submit art is December 23rd, so just over 2 weeks!! If you are having trouble starting on your art piece or just need some general advice, please feel free to ping or PM any of us organizers and we'll help you out best we can. :) Also on the same note: if you are doing traditional artwork and would like your artwork touched up on Photoshop before submission (example: to increase the contrast of the lines or to clean up some parts of the drawing), you may also send your artwork to me and I'll help you out best I can!





Once you are done, please submit your artwork through 

~ If you are having difficulties with the form, you can also PM your artwork to us and we'll submit it under your name. Thanks so much and we look forward to seeing your beautiful artwork!












            


              @


do you know of a good image hoster? I have traditional and used to use tinypic but it isn't working.            


              @

 not sure if i'm allowed to interject here but i always use 

 to host images on my store and whatnot. not sure if this'd help, just a suggestion :D            


              @





ahh so sad I missed this :'D will there be another event like this in the future?             


              @

 just thought I'd let you know that I may be late (hopefully not though) because of school and finals creeping up on me.


Hopefully I'll be able to the artwork but my last class is on the 15th, so I might be pushing it since I'm pretty slow with drawing (along with the commissions I have to do ;;)            


              @


Lizzi suggests these:






@


Oh no :( And prospectively, yes! I'll add you to the pinglist for next year's event.





@


Thank you for the advance notice! Don't feel like you need to rush too hard and compromise quality.





            


              @

 @


thank you~ I'll be able to submit my artwork now!            


              @





Yay! Thank you ^^            


              Just submitted my art!             


              @





I just have a quick question. What's a good size to make the image? I don't know what would work best in a dragon bio. Thanks!            


              @


I believe the max width of the dragon bios are 600px! So the height doesn't matter as long as the width is that long :D            


              Submitted! Ahhhh I'm excited!!             


              Submitted! So happy I got that done, haha.

Hey everyone! Just a quick reminder that the deadline for submitting your Secret Santa entry is fast approaching (Saturday, December 23rd at 23:59, just before rollover into December 24th). Once your submission is completed, submit it through this

 Please do not mail Hexlash with your completed art. Thanks and we're all looking forward to seeing your entries! :)            


              

            


              I'm almost done with mine <3 Thanks for the reminder!            


              @

 oo thanks for the reminder! i’m finishing the colouring up on mine right now so its nearly there but it’ll probably be getting submitted Friday bc im sort of compromised right now.            


              @

 thanks for the reminding ping, I’m already working on mine :)            


              @

 I thought that i had already submitted my artwork            


              Almost done with mine too <3            


              @

 Thanks for the reminder! I'll start sometime later and should end up finishing mine sometime tomorrow ^^            


              @





Whoops! 

. There was a glitch in the Google sheet, so your name was put into the ping list. Sorry!             


              @


@

Hello! Sorry for pinging all three of you and if this is a silly question.


But I have a quick question on watermarks and signatures. Are we allowed to include them in the art? I just thought I'd ask before I finalize and submit my drawing!            


              @

 Yup! You can put a watermark and/or your signature on your picture.             


              Submitted mine. Please let me know if there are any issues            


              @

 Not at all! That's perfectly fine. :)            


              And submitted!  Hope all is okay, aha ;;            


              Submitted! Please let me know if I did something wrong!            


              Submitted. Took longer than expected, but worth it!





I'm so excited! I hope they like it.            


              I just submitted mine! If there's anything wrong with it, please tell me! (^∀ ^; )




            


              submitted mine 

 I hope they like it!!!            


              I'll be submitting mine today! I've almost completed it, it just needs a few touch ups~            


              Hey everyone! Hope you all are having a fantastic winter break. :)





If you haven't done so already, this is one last reminder that the deadline to submit your artwork is technically in 21 hours, just before rollover into December 24th. However, I will keep the entry form open throughout the 24th to allow any last minute entries or for anyone who did multiple pieces of art!





If you are a bit late, it's not the biggest deal. If something important came up, I understand that family and real life come first! But please do bear in mind that a completed entry is required to participate in next year's Secret Santa.





On a closing note, everyone's art looks 

! Honestly you guys are blowing me away with all the amazing artwork that I've seen so far, and I can't wait to share everyone's entries on Christmas Day!!

              Finally submitted my art :D            


              Hmm I wonder if I have enough time to finish off a second piece "-3-            


              @

 I'm coloring my part right now, I'll send it as soon as possible ^^            


              @

 quick question! I noticed a small mistake with my submission; would it be okay to fix it then re-submit it later today?


Also, the deadline's the same time, right?            


              Submitted mine a few days ago :)            


              pretty much done with one, but i wanted to try and do multiple things so i'll probably be submitting pretty close to the deadline but don't worry!            


              Fineshed my part right now! I'll submit it in a minute!            


              @

 Real life seriously screwed me over, but the piece is on its way!! It'll be done before I go to sleep, I swear on the Arcanist!            


              Submitted mine! How exciting~            


              @


Of course! Just PM me with a link to the updated version of your entry. :)            


              @

 I just submitted my entry, let me know if there is anything wrong :)            


              Submitted! Pretty satisfied with how it turned out            


              

 putting the finishing touches on mine before sending it over!            


              submitted my drawing :0)            


              Nearly done! It took far, far longer than I expected, but when I submit it, please do tell me if I need to change anything!             


              @


Some life things came up, but can I send it to you tomorrow?             


              @


Yeah not a problem! The form will still be open tomorrow so please send it when you are able~            


              submitted the first one! still not done with the others though so i'll try to get them in sometime tomorrow. first one took me ages but i dont know if i'm still completely happy with it so i want to get at least one more in ^^;            


              Hey backup Santas! It looks like some people haven't received art yet, and I would like some people on standby in case their Santas haven't sent in anything by the time Christmas rolls around.





If you aren't free, no worries! But if you are available to do extra art, please fill out this form and reply to the thread. (No need to ping as I am subscribed, but I understand if it happens out of habit). Thank you very much for helping to make everyone's Christmas special!

              Oh, gosh! My piece is down to the wire, but if I can finish one on a tight schedule, I can finish two!

              @

 I'm super sorry for delay, the drawing is ready, but I wanted to attach speedpaint link as well (that's possible, right? with Christmas music etc) and rendering on this one suddenly takes forever on my computer. Can I still send submission when it'll be finished? A computer tells me that it needs about 2-4 hours to render + about 10 mins to upload on youtube, so can I send form this night? Again, sorry, I was sure it will be done by this evening, my bad.            


              @


Ah what a cute idea, I'd love to see it once it's done!! What you can do is submit the form with just the art for now, then PM me the link to the speedpaint in the morning once it's finished rendering. :) I'll make a note to update your entry with a link to the speedpaint~

Ahh!! I am so, so, so sorry for my lateness.... I’ll have it done soon as possible. I guess lateness runs in the family, and life pulled my away from drawing, much to my dismay... Working on it right now!! I can 100% guarantee that I will have it finished :)            


              Ok, second one submitted (though I started it first). Sorry it's a bit late, it took me a lot of time to do.            


              hmph, that simply will not do!

That said, i could also be a replacement santa:

              @


I did it! I finally finished! I am so, so, so sorry for the delay, it took much longer than I originally planned. Unfortunately, I had to take the picture on my phone, so I don’t exactly have expert editing abilities, so if it isn’t too late, would you mind possibly cropping out the background with Photoshop? I already adjusted the lighting and coloring, but if you feel that anything else should be changed to improve the quality, that would be great! However, please just do whatever is easier :)            


              @


Not a problem! I'll PM you a copy of the edited image             


              Sorry, I won't be able to be a back up artist. Can't wait to see all the art though!            


              Whoa! Everyone's art looks so good! 





Anyway, thank you to @

 for the amazing art of Rose! Her pose is so regal and perfect and aaa thank you!            


              Merry Christmas everyone!! All art submissions have been posted on the front page, go check them out! (And be prepared to have your mind blown by how amazing they are :D)






















Again, thank you all so much for making this event a smashing success! Happy holidays and we look forward to seeing you again next year. :)








@


I was not your original Santa, but I drew something for you really quick because your original Santa told me they were not able to make it. I'll refine it over the course of the next few days and give you a much more completed version!

You 4 have not received art yet... I am incredibly sorry for the inconvenience. I already have you all covered by Backup Santas, so the art will come soon! Thank you so much for your patience. :')





Special thanks to @

Thank you so much for the amazing art <3


It is just perfect *-* I love it so much, I could cry >///< Thank you for drawing her, I really wondered, what my SS would draw for me and was super hyped, when I saw the ping.


May I asked if you have a DA or Toyhouse account, so that I can link your art back to you (at toyhouse) or should I use your fr clan profile?





@


(no need to apologise for all the pings, I get up to around 10-20 pings every day, especially when it is NotN, because I am on the Gen1 hoarder pinglist xD)





I am happy you like the drawings :3 When I saw, that I had you for my SS, I just needed to draw more than one thing, because without you, there would not be this amazing Art trade, so thank you, @

 and @

 for making this happen :3

 You're very welcome! I only realized after starting him how complicated his accent was going to be, haha.  ((Also, would I be able to use him as a full body example in my art shop? My current examples are over two years old))            


              @

You're welcome! I'd love to read their lore when you do write it. ^^ That was probably the most challenging thing I've ever drawn digitally - it took 42 layers, including 4 sketch layers for all of the layered apparel. ^^" Totally worth it, and I'll be happy to do this again next year!!            


              @

 it’s okay! I love it to bits <3             


              @


aaa youre very welcome!! im so glad you like them, i wasnt sure if youd like pixels (some people dont) but i had originally started a painting for arrow and just. didnt like it at all bc i have very little practice drawing guys bc i can never get them to look as nice as i want lol (i tried though)





if you want any other versions like just the lines or flat colors or in a different size please let me know! i can resize them in photoshop without the pixels blurring so it would be no problem ^^





youre welcome again though! i hope your day gets better and merry christmas! <3            


              @





Oh, thank you! Cienna looks so great in your style. I love her expression and paws. I'm putting it straight into her bio :D

All the art looks so great! I'm so happy the Secret Santa worked so well.

 Truth be told, I was so busy worrying about the submissions for the event and prepping to go on holidays this morning that I wasn't too hung up about not getting a picture on time. But the moment I saw the artwork of Selaphire my jaw dropped


I LOVE IT SO MUCH AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH THANKYOU            


              @





Thank the STARS! I was so worried it wouldn't be good, but knowing you like it so much is a huge relief! I'm glad I finished it :D

Thank you! Meinira looks so cute!

Ohmigosh!! Thank you so, so, so much for the drawing of Nicoli! It’s perfect! The circuits are so luminescent and his accent is drawn amazingly! I’ve had some lore planned for him for quite a while, but your artwork says so much about his personallity, and it really matches what I was planning to write. Your art style, as a whole, is fantastic, and I am just so overwhelmed by the perfection that I know I’m rambling by now :P Anyhow, thank you so much! And merry Christmas!            


              @


Your welcome i am gald that you like it, i left him in uniform gray to sort of be a ghost of the past but i dont think it really work. I had planned to draw his second face but honestly i was running out of time to draw so i missed out the second face. also i just wanted to let you know that i have now posted the same image here with a watermark




            


              @

 awww thank you!! the hat and lights are so cute!





@

 yayy glad you like it!             


              @


You're welcome! She was fun to draw.


@


Thanks for drawing my progen!            


              @


i think the grey uniform and no face definitely work to support the ghost of the past idea, it strengthens the contrast between past and present and adds a sort of not-real or dark quality to it that can show that it's a part of him that he could leave behind but has been hanging on to for a long time, but also that it's a negative and harmful image of himself that he needs to let go to ever move on. i think you did a v good job, thank you again!!            


              @

 Im aboslutely speachless this art is amazing i cannot even describe how blown away and happy i am            


              :000 I love mine aaaa, tysm to whoever drew it!            


              @





Thank you so much for the lovely picture of Sakura! I was thinking back to the choices I left for my Secret Santa and felt very bad cause I had no preferences for who I wanted drawn because I’m a very indecisive person...Seeing Sakura definitely made my day though! She looks amazing and the atmosphere fits her perfectly! Unfortunately I’m out of town so it’s really hard to access her bio on mobile but I’ll add it there once I get back!


Merry (late) Christmas!

I'm glad you like her! Merry (even later) Christmas to you as well!

 Bahh oh my goodness I'm so glad you enjoy how she turned out! ;;o;; She was truly a joy to work on; you've got such the pretty dragon there. ♥ Apologies that I didn't include all of her apparel pieces, though. It was slowly becoming a hassle with the wing thorns. ;;~;;





@

 

 Oh goshh can I just say I adore your human style- his anatomy looks so perfect (heck I'm envying how you draw your legs) and I really love how you incorporated his Skink gene into the Gijinka design! *o* Bahh thank you so much for drawing my lovely guy as a person.~ Really hoping you had an absolutely wonderful Christmas!





Apologies for the delayed responses!
